# README file creator
An application that creates a project README for the user based on the user inputs.

## About the project
I have created a README file creator application using javascript and node.js. The application prompts the user to provide various sets of information in the bash terminal, such as project name, description, license details and contact details. Once the information has been entered a README file is created with all of the user inputs, a license badge at the top of the README and an active table of contents.
